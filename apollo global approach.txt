GearLocker.Core --> VCS

G1) Finish design for GearLocker.Core. The VCS part is going to be a very important part of Apollo.
G2) Implement GearLocker.Core and iron out any issues with the in-memory VCS system and the serialization system.



D1) Create design for the symbolic system in dnA. This will also be an important part of apollo.
D2) Implement the symbolic system in dnA.



A1) Write down the user uses / features of the system. A bullet list will do, no need to write it out completely. Mindmaps may help here. 

A2) Create a diagram with the possible use cases and identify all the actors for apollo. It's pretty certain that the user will not be the only actor.

A3) For each feature attach it to a use case. If a feature has no matching use case then we're missing something in the use case diagram.

A4)

An) Define the programming languages used for Apollo. Obviously C# will be used in some spots, however F# also looks pretty good but it has some raw sides (i.e. source files have to be ordered, etc.). Boo might also be a solution, however we'll need to find out how BooLangStudio is doing.
