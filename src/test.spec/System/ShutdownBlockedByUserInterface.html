        <h2>What if the shut down must be blocked by the User Interface?</h2>
        <p>
            In some cases the User Interface must be able to block an unforced shut down process. For instance when
            the user has unsaved files open. In this case the user interface should be able to block the shut down process
            on the users request.
        </p>

        <div class="Example">
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p concordion:execute="ShutdownApollo()">
                When a shutdown is requested the system will <b concordion:assertEquals="HasShutdownStarted()">start</b> the shut down process. However if for instance
                the user has unsaved files open then the User Interface should be able to <b concordion:assertEquals="HasShutdownBeenStopped()">stop</b> the shut down process so
                that the users files can be saved correctly.
                Once this is done the User Interface can re-start the shut down process again. If this process is not stopped then it
                should run <b concordion:assertEquals="HasShutdownCompletedSuccessfully()">succesfully</b>.
