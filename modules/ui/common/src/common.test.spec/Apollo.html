        <title>Regression tests for the Apollo API</title>
    </head>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The following pages provide access to the different regression tests for the Apollo API. These tests will load the 
            Apollo application and manipulate this application through the same API that the User Interface (UI) uses. The goal for
            these tests is to verify that the integration of the UI business layer with the Apollo framework has been done correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that these tests are regression tests only, not UI tests. At no point will UI controls be manipulated.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Starting and stopping Apollo.</h2>
        <p>
            The first tests will test the behavior of the system for start-up and shutdown.
        </p>
        <!--
            Suggested tests:
            - When starting the system ??
            - When the system is done loading, then a message is send
            - When the user asks for a shutdown then the system checks if we can shutdown
            - Given that we can shutdown, when the user asks for a shutdown, then the system terminates
