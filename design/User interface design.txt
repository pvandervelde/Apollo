Tasks the user would want to use the platform for:

1)  Learn about the flow / physical phenomena in a specific case
    a) Create simulation model
    b) Run simulation
    c) Validate
    d) Check simulation results
    e) Change simulation model
    f) Rerun simulation
    g) Validate
    h) Check simulation results and compare with previous version
    i) ....

2)  Feedback loops (provide flowcondition for x lift etc.) (= beginning of optimization)
    a)

3)  Improve design of a component
    a) Create simulation model
    b) Run simulation
    c) Validate (??)
    d) Check simulation results
    e) Change simulation model
    f) Rerun simulation
    g) Validate
    h) Check simulation results and compare with previous version
    i) ....


Could these 3 tasks lead to a project wizzard?? If so then the user should be able to add new
types of projects with ease. It should also be possible to circumvent the wizzard.



So the actual functions are
1)  Create simulation model
    a)  Create simulation project
    b)  Select simulation type(s) (e.g. flow, internal)
    c)  Set general simulation variables (e.g speed etc.)
    d)  Select simulation components
    e)  Create simulation model (geometry)
    f)  Apply boundary conditions
    g)  Create discretization
2)  Run simulation
    a)  Initialize solution
    b)  Solve (either iterative / direct)
3)  Validate model
    a)  On gridded models, run grid convergence
    b)  On iterative models, run iterative convergence
    c)  Calculate error bounds
4)  Check results
    a)
5)  Change simulation model
    a)  Create new simulation
    b)  Copy data from original model (i.e. model that is going to be changed)
    c)
