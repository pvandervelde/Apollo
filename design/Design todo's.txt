- Define numerics & physics
  - Which physics do we need / want
  - Which equations do we need to solve
    - What problems can we expect
  - Which algorithms do we require
  - Where could be the problems
  - How to split the physics / algorithms

- How do we deal with the knowledge base stuff

- Define structure of system. Which modules / components use which other modules and how
- Define how numerics & physics will be constructed --> Define tree that describes the building blocks --> NO INTERFACES ETC
