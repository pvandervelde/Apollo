- Use pre- and postconditions. Indicate for each method / property. For public methods / properties check the pre-conditions with an exception. For non-public methods check the pre-conditions with an assert.

- Make everything internal / private as much as possible. Figure out how to test private / internal parts.

- Reduce storage to a minimum. Try not to store global data on a class of which we'll have lots of copies (e.g. vertices, or points etc.)

- Reduce useage of strings.

FILE WRITING
XML
- Write all elements in CamelCasing

DOCUMENTATION:
- Never refer to the class/method/property etc. itself on it's own documentation
- Always refer to the class/method/property by a <see ...> element the first time. After that use <code> tags
-
