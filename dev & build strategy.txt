== Development ==
- Use PQM to commit to the trunk branch


== Issue tracking ==
Bugs are tracked in a bug tracker
To-do / Features should be tracked differently (wiki or something)


== VCS usage ==
- Tag each version that can be build with: ABOTD - DATE (where ABOTD stands for Apollo Build Of The Day)


== Build ==


Version numbering
Format: Major.Minor.Release.Build
Increase build on each succesful build(?)
Increase Release for each release which only contains fixes. Releases never have features added
Increase Minor for each release which has both bug fixes and some features added
Increase Major for each release that makes either:
  - Breaking changes
  - Changes the internal or external storage format


== Build scripts ==
Build:
- Version number generation
- Installer
- Documentation

- Build (Debug) --> Build numbers are fixed
  --> Build all source
- Check (Debug)  --> Build numbers are fixed
  --> Build all source
  --> Build documentation
  --> Build installer
  --> Run unit tests
  --> Run code coverage
  --> Run FxCop
- Internal (Release) --> Build numbers are major.minor.revision.automatic
