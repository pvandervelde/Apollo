        This file holds the sequences for the license validation service. One or more sequences may be
        placed in this file. Each sequence has the following layout:
        
        <sequence period="Hourly" 
                  modifier="1" 
                  isPeriodic="true"
                  start="FromLoad" />
        
        The period may be either one of:
        - Minutely
        - Hourly
        - Daily
        - Weekly
        - Fortnightly
        - Monthly
        - Yearly
        
        The modifier may be any number between 0 and 255 (although high numbers may be a bit ridiculous)
        
        The periocity may be either 'true' or 'false'
        
        The start may be one of:
        - The string 'frombuild' to indicate that it should store the time the application was build
        - The string 'frominstall' to indicate that it should store the time the application was installed
        - The string 'fromload' to indicate that it should store the time the application was loaded
        - A date & time formatted according to the DateTimeOffset round-trip method
